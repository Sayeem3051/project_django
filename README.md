## Security Considerations
- Biometric data is stored securely and used only for attendance verification
- User passwords are hashed and not stored in plaintext
- CSRF protection is enabled for all forms
- User permissions are strictly enforced

## Future Enhancements
- Mobile application integration
- Real-time notifications
- Advanced analytics dashboard
- Integration with HR systems
- Geolocation-based attendance
